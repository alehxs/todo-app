# My First Svelte To-Do App 📝

This is my first project with Svelte. My main goal was to learn by building a todo app.

---

## ✅ Features

Even for a basic app, it handles all the core to-do list functionalities:
* **Add new tasks** to the list.
* **Mark tasks as complete** with a satisfying strikethrough.
* **Delete tasks** you no longer need.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built using the modern Svelte ecosystem:

* **[Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/)**: Using the new Runes (`$state`, `$props`) for reactivity.
* **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)**: The official application framework for Svelte.
* **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: For a fast development experience.
* **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: For type safety

## 🚀 My Learning Journey

The main purpose of this project was to learn. Here are a few key concepts I focused on:

* **Reactive State Management**: Get comfortable with `$state` to create and update state variables.
* **Component Composition**: Understand how to pass data and functions down to child components using `$props`.
* **Event Handling**: Wire up form submissions (`onsubmit`) and button clicks (`onclick`).
